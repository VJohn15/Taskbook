 *  An integer N (> 1) and two points A, B (A < B) on the real axis are given.
 * The segment [A, B] is divided into N sub-segments of equal length.
 * Output the length H of each sub-segment and then output the values of a function F(X) = 1 − sin(X) at points dividing the segment [A, B]:
F(A),    F(A + H),    F(A + 2·H),    …,    F(B).
