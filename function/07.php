 * Write a real-valued function Calc(A, B, Op) that performs an arithmetic operation over nonzero real numbers A and B and returns the result value.
 * An arithmetic operation is determined by integer parameter Op as follows: 1 — subtraction, 2 — multiplication, 3 — division, and addition otherwise. Having input real numbers A, B and integers N1, N2, N3 and using this function, perform over given A, B three operations determined by given N1, N2, N3.
 * Output the result value of each operation.
